Enter "TV-Y" as the MPAA rating to display the TV-Y rating image, enter "TV-7" to display the TV-Y7 rating image, and enter "UK:R18" to display the R18 rating image.

• I changed the code for all the cases so that movie folders containing extensions in the name (3d, 4k, etc.) instead of the movie file itself will cause the case to display correctly. Thanks to kokobsb for reporting the bug. I'm pretty sure it's been reported in the past, I just haven't gotten around to fixing it until now.
• I fixed a problem where the Fullscreen TV Info page was displaying the Top Art twice and the Fullscreen Movie Info page was displaying the logo and title as text underneath. Thanks to nomnom27 for reporting the bug!

• I added "GET ARTWORK" buttons to the Top Menu for Artwork Beef where the Artwork Downloader buttons used to be. I also changed the context menu buttons to use Artwork Beef.
• I added code to display extra fanart added by Artwork Beef. Artwork Beef adds additional fanart (based on your settings) in the movie folder (not in an extrafanart subfolder). I also added a new button named "AB FANART" in the Top Menu under Art that enables this fanart and works in conjunction with "EXTRA FANART".
• I added code to utilize the AutoCompletion for virtual keyboard Add-on. Once you begin to typing the autocomplete will popup at the bottom of the screen. Scrolling down from any of the keys on the bottom of the virtual keyboard will take you to the results. Thanks to kobyboy for the request!

• I also changed the colordiffuse for some of the images in the Download Subtitle popup to make it easier to read. Thanks to StoneT for the suggestion!
• I fixed a few things with Live TV. The channel numbers were not showing, I added a library status under Live TV that displays the total number of channels, and the channel display popup now mimics the Leia version of Estuary. Thanks to gamaru for reporting the bug!
• The "PERSONALISE MEDIA FLAGS BAR" in the Top Menu was not focusing on the correct section of Skin Settings when selected.

• I adjusted the size of the KodiFlix Options in the Top Menu so that all the options are now visible.

• I changed the list for ViewsRightList and ViewsRightListTV to "list" instead of "fixedlist" so that the titles don't scroll unless you reach the bottom of the page. Thanks to StoneT for the request and MB1968 for providing the change!

-----------------------------------------

VERSION 1.0.1.4 - RELEASE DATE 01/19/2019

-----------------------------------------

VERSION 1.0.1.3 - RELEASE DATE 01/1/2019

ADDITIONS:

• There was also broken code in KodiFlix and KodiFlixTV to display a resume flag in the top right corner that I recently noticed and fixed. There is a new radio button in the Top Menu for KodiFlix/KodiFlixTV that controls the resume flag that appears when viewing Movies/TV Show episodes.

FIXES:
• I adjusted the size of the fanart shadow for KodiFlixTV. I forgot about that shadow on the last update. Thanks to nomnom27 for reporting the bug.

-----------------------------------------

VERSION 1.0.1.0 - RELEASE DATE 11/24/2018

• Per grimmace92's request, I added the awards code to the KodiFlix media flags.
• I was able to add the spine image to the front of the jewel box for Shelf 3D v2. However, right now the artist name will not display if the spine is missing...still working that part.
• Per LupinSansei's request, I added a shadow to the left border of the KodiFlix and KodiFlixTV views. This makes the Movie/TV Show information easier to read. It can be disabled from the Top Menu KodiFlix options with the new "REMOVE SHADOW" button.
• Per abress's request, I added code to the Right List music view that will display the local discart first if available. If not, it will use the Skin Helper Service to display the discart. There is also a new button in the Top Menu to enable/disable the discart.

FIXES:
• I fixed a problem with style5 of the music player not displaying the music codec logo. Thanks to abress for reporting the bug.

I also increased the size of the textbox for the artist name and enabled scrolling if the name is too long to display. Thanks to Dave.B for reporting the bug.
• I fixed a problem with the disc art animation in style5 of the music player.  If you paused the song, the disc was sliding too far to the left.  It will now hide behind the album cover until you resume the song.
• I changed the aspectratio for the next song album cover in style5 and style3d of the music player.  It was not displaying the entire album cover.
• I fixed a problem with the Rotten Tomatoes rating flag in KodiFlix displaying when the focused item was empty.
• The IMDb Top 250 media flag and rating was not displaying.
• I adjusted the position of the discart in widgets...it was a little low.

• I changed the spine and thumbback code. This affects List 3D v2 and Shelf 3D v2 in music views as well as style3D in the music player. It appears that the accepted image name for the thummback image is going to be back.jpg and the spine image will be spine.jpg.

-----------------------------------------

VERSION 1.0.0.9 - RELEASE DATE 11/03/2018

ADDITIONS:
• I added SkinHelper awards to the RightList view. Oscar images (15 maximum) will appear above the movie poster if the movie was nominated for or won an Oscar. The image will be slightly transparent if only nonimated. This was supposed to be part of the 1.0.0.8 update, but I forgot to add the code...sorry. Thanks to chrissix for providing the code.
• I added the ability for the library editor script to edit information for music albums and songs.
• The 3D music layout will now display the tracklist (up to 14) and album studio on the back of the jewel box (similar to List3D v2). This info will only display if you are missing the thumbback image.
• I changed the color code for the tracklist in RightList music. The selected track will be highligthed by your header color. This was provided by Angelinas some time back, but I never could get it to work on Krypton. It works just fine on Leia.
• I added the Skinhelper clearlogos option to the 3D music player layout.

FIXES:
• I fixed a problem with the 3D music layout. The spine was not displaying on the back of the jewel box. Thanks to Asiapentti for reporting the bug.
• I adjusted the size of the Critics Consensus textbox on the Video Info page so that it doesn't spill onto the IMDB info if the movie is not in the IMDB Top 250. Thanks to tad61 for reporting the bug.
• I tweaked the "Trailer" button on the Video Info page to more closely mimic how the Estuary Skin handles trailers. Thanks to ewaterke for reporting the bug.

MAINTENANCE:
• Per chrissix's request, I adjusted the size of the image in the KodiFlix Landscape and Clearart layouts to a 16:9 aspect ratio. I also added a new animation to the Landscape layout. When you hide the background panel the thumbnail will slide down to the bottom of the floor for unfocused thumbnails.  The reflection in turn will slide up to meet the thumbnail. For the focused thumbnail animation to work you must also remove the focus surround.

• I added SkinHelper awards to the RightList view.  Oscar images (15 maximum) will appear above the movie poster if the movie was nominated for or won an Oscar.  The image will be slightly transparent if only nonimated.  Thanks to chrissix for providing the code.
• I added the original List 3D music view to the Top Menu music view list, so there are now two available to choose from...List 3D and List 3D v2.  This required a new image to be added to Textures.xbt.
• I added the duration info to the Wall 3D view.
• Per jasn's request, I added the ability to enable/disable the furniture on all the music player styles by hitting the "Info" key on your keyboard (letter "I" by default).  I also added the multi-logo code to style 5.
• I added some code to display the currently selected watch flag for widgets.  The original code only displayed the default watched flag regardless of which flag you chose.  Thanks to Jumpy73 for requesting the addition.
• Per OrbS82User's request, I centered the video widgets when the horizontal menu bar is enabled.  Per Jumpy73's request, I made this change for the virtual menu in Skin Settings as well.
• Per OrbS82User's request, I added the IMDb Top 250 logo and rating to the media flags.
• I gave the Video Info page a facelift.  I added Theatrical release info, added The Movie Database rating info, and changed how some of the other ratings are displayed.  Thanks to chrissix for providing the code for these enhancements.

FIXES:
• The "CHANGELOG" label was removed in Krypton.  You can include Addon changes in the addon.xml file of the Addon as "news" and it is displayed under "WHAT'S NEW" in the Addon Info window.  This was changed in Krypton.  However, I will continue to provide a changelog.txt file with every Leia update.
• I changed the "CHANGELOG" label to "DEPENDENCIES" on the Addon Info screen.  Selecting this will now show what dependencies are associated with the Addon.
• I fixed a few message IDs in the language file that were not displaying correctly.
• I fixed a bug in the Right List view where the sets discart was not showing. I'll check the rest of the views to see if they all require an update.
• I fixed a bug in the Settings widget where the Release Notes link was not working properly. The Release Notes will now begin displaying a copy of the latest update info from the changelog.
• I fixed a bug in the List 3D v2 music view where the track list and duration was showing with or without a thumbback image.
• I fixed a bug in the Shelf 3D music view where the top left album count and album list were not working...as well as the album thumbs not showing on the back of the jewel box.
• I removed the option in Skin Settings>Options Menu to show time in hours and minutes.  Leia displays the time for videos in HH:MM:SS by default.  This affects all views.  The duration of the movie will no longer show "minutes" after the HH:MM:SS.
• I fixed a bug in the top menu with List 3D, List 3D v2, Shelf 3D, Shelf 3D v2 and Wall 3D.  When you activated these views, they would not automatically switch to the view.
• I fixed a bug in the Middle List and Middle List 967 views where the watched flag was not showing the flag color.
• I fixed a bug where the playback list at skin startup was not working.  This was mentioned a few months back, but I've been unable to get it working.  Purge asked me about it again the other day and I was determined to make it work again.  Thanks for the extra motivation Purge!  Haha.
• I forgot to add the resume flag for the KodiFlix view to Leia.  That image is part of this update.  However, after looking at the KodiFlix code again I noticed that I was missing the ability to display the new flag and enable/disable the new and watched flag.  That code is now added, and there is a new button on the Top Menu under "KODIFLIX OPTIONS/CHANGE VIEW" named "SHOW FLAGS".  There are four options...show neither the watched flag nor the new flag, show only the watched flag, show only the new flag (last 9 movies/TV Shows/episodes added to your library), or show both flags.  Thanks to Purge again for asking about the resume flag.
• I fixed a bug in the media flags where the white audio flag was overlapping the flag to its left when you enabled "LOGO" as the "AUDIO AND SUBTITLE FLAG".  Thanks to OrbS82User for reporting the bug.
• I fixed a bug in the Movie Info screen where the language and subtitle text was not displaying.  Thanks to OrbS82User for reporting the bug and Angelinas for providing the fix.

• I fixed a bug where the Program Addons view was not displaying the summary and description of the addons.  The Video Addons view was also not displaying the version and author.  Thanks to MB1968 for the request.

MAINTENANCE:
• There is a new arial.ttf font file in the fonts folder.  This version of the font allows languages other than English to display correctly.  Thanks to Wanilton for the suggestion.
• Please remove the file script-Rom_Collection_Browser-main.xml.  It is no longer needed.  Disregard if you are installing this Skin for the first time.
• I noticed some errors in the log file, so I did some house cleaning to some of the files to remedy the errors.
• The list of views in the Music Top Menu is now in alphabetical order.  The views for Movies, TV Shows and Music are now listed in alphabetical order as you scroll through the activated views as well.  I've been intending to fix this for a while.
• Make sure you install my updated version of the Colored Mediaicons.  The colored subtitle image was not displaying correctly in version 0.0.7 of the addon.

-----------------------------------------

VERSION 1.0.0.7 - RELEASE DATE 07/21/2018

ADDITIONS:
• I've started adding code to the Views xml files that will display local discart first and then revert to the Skin Helper Addon if local discart is missing.  I tested this code first with Right List, so I'll start at the top alphabetically with Glass List and work my down...Glass List is included with this update.  I believe chrissix was the first to request this addition to the code.
FIXES:
• There was a bug with the "SHOW ORIGINAL TITLE" and "LOGO AS TITLE (ON TOP IF AVAILABLE)" buttons in the Top Menu.  JanM201 reported this bug a while back, and I thought I had it fixed.  However, I recently reinstalled KODI and found that when you toggle one of them on it enables both at the same time.  There is a new string named videotitle that will be added to your settings.xml file after you install this update that fixes the problem.  Thanks to JanM201 for reporting the bug.

-----------------------------------------

VERSION 1.0.0.6 - RELEASE DATE 05/10/2018

FIXES:
• There was code missing for a feature in KodiFlixTV.  You now have the option to display unwatched episode info on the TV Show poster.  There is a new radio button on the Top Menu named "UNWATCHED ICON".  The radio button will not display if you have the Default layout selected.
• I changed the font for the unwatched episode info when "THUMBNAIL INFO" is enabled for the Default layout in KodiFlixTV.  It was calling for a font that didn't exist.
• I fixed the problem with List 3D showing on the root music menu.  Thanks to Dave.B for reporting the bug.

FIXES:
• Per Jumpy73's request, I updated the code for discart in widgets to the latest that Angelinas provided.
• I updated the rating star code in the LowList view for music.  The star was not displaying.  Thanks to Jumpy73 for reporting the bug.

VERSION 1.0.0.1 - RELEASE DATE 03/21/2018

ADDITIONS:
• Per grimmace92's request, I added a fresh and certified fresh image to the Rotten Tomatoes media flag for Kodiflix.
• Per MB1968's request, I added some code to KodiFlixTV to show the title of a TV Show when you are viewing seasons and there is no logo available when "Show Logo" is enabled.
• Per MB1968's request, I changed the code for the KodiFlix watched flag so that it also displays for sets.
• I added Angelinas' code for menu widgets that displays the disc art for music smart playlists.  Thanks to Angelinas for the code!
• I added Angelinas' code for menu widgets that displays the TV Show cast list.  Thanks to Angelinas for the code!
• I changed the rating code for the Music Info screen to show a rating of 0-10 instead of 0-5.  This has also been applied to the LowList and RightList View.  Thanks to Angelinas for the code!
• Per AnthonyJS02's request, I added a new "REMOVE TAGLINE" option to the Top Menu under "VIEW OPTIONS/CHANGE VIEW" submenu.  This will enable/disable the tagline in the RightList View.
• I added an animation to the discart for the album view in the RightList View.  The discart will fade out when you move over to the track list and fade in again when you move back to the album list.
• Per nomnom27's request, I added a new "HIDE STUDIO/LOGO FOR BOXSETS" option to the Top Menu for KodiFlix & KodiFlixTV.
FIXES:
• I fixed a bug on the Dialogue Video Info screen.  If you had "Logo as Title" enabled and "Banner" selected for "Dialogue Top Art", the banner would not display if the clearlogo was missing. Thanks to MB1968 for reporting the bug.
• I fixed the code for boxsets in KodiFlixTV. It was not displaying the studio icon on the boxset case. Thanks to nomnom27 for reporting the bug.
• I fixed a bug where the Rotten Tomatoes media flag was displayed when sets were enabled or when using KodiFlixTV.  Thanks to MB1968 for reporting the bug.
• I changed the Hide Info radio button label for KodiFlixTV to "HIDE TV SHOW INFO" instead of "HIDE MOVIE INFO".
• I fixed a bug in KodiFlixTV where the title label was displaying the wrong text when "Show Logo" was enabled.
• I fixed a bug in List3Dv2 where the tracklist and duration was visible when a thumbback image was available in album view.  Thanks to Asiapentti for reporting the bug.
• This fix is only half way there.  I added some includes (suggested by Angelinas) to the track list in the RightList album view to fix a problem reported by MB1968.  Right now the selected track will change to your colorheader setting only if you go to the track view, select a track, and return to the album view.  I'm still working with Angelinas to get this working properly.  Thanks to Angelinas for the assistance.
