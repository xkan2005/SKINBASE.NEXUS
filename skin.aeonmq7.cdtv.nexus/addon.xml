• I changed the code to display the progress bar and percentage info when cleaning your library. Thanks to shedrock for the
	request and Wanilton for the assist!
• I added the mini weather from MQ 8 to MQ 7 per shedrock's request. You can enable/disable this from Skin Settings >
	Main Menu.
• I added code to display the percentage played even when a file has been marked as watched. Thanks to shedrock for
	the request!
• I added code to display the actress images from the Actress Artwork Add-on by chrissix. This will display actress images on
	your Video Info page as well as the RightList and Shelf3D View. I'll add to other views as time permits. Read the Add-on's
	thread for more info. Thanks to chrissix for the Add-on and his hard work on the code!
• I added another weather code (hazy/day) to the sunny weather animation.
• I added code to display Dutch MPAA ratings. You can display seven different flags by entering the following text for your
	MPAA Rating...NL-AL, NL-MG6, NL-6, NL-9, NL-12, NL-16, NL-18. Thanks to MB1968 for the request!
• I added an image to the round language media flags for Japanese language. Thanks to Kupo91 for reporting the
	missing flag!
• I added a setting to the Top Menu named "UP NEXT ART" under "VIEW OPTIONS/CHANGE VIEW". This will allow you to
	choose which artwork is displayed for the Up Next Add-on. The setting has three options...LANDSCAPE, FANART
	and THUMB. Thanks to nomnom27 for the request![CR]
